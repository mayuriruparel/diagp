State Chart Diagram Editor:

1. Use joint.js demo StatChart (http://www.jointjs.com/demos/umlsc) as the base
2. States:
   - nice/clean professional looking state symbols/shapes: rectangle (rounded corner, header with label), 
     diamond (with label), sync bars (horizontal/vertical) and hexagon (header with label).
   - resize state by dragging on its corner or side
   - nested state: child state can only move within the boundary of parent state
   - readonly state: state can not be moved, transitions going into/out can not be moved either.
3. Transitions:
   - transitions ends must be conneted to states at all time but still allow drag/drop ends to be attached to another state.
   - movable transition label/name
   - readonly transition (can not be moved or re-routed)
   - transition style (curve, straight line, zig-zag with rounded corner) that can be re-shapped by dragging on transition segment
4. javascript API
   - add state or child state with initial position
   - remove state (also auto remove all incoming and outgoing transitions)
   - update state attributes (text color, background color, border color, symbol shape, readonly)
   - add transitions with specified position and routing
   - update transition attributes (routing style, label text color, label background color, line color, ends must be same color as transition line)
   - highlight/un-highlight the state and/or transitions with visual effect  
   - hide / un-hide states - auto hide / un-hide all incoming/outgoing transitions
   - scroll to a specific state or transition (bring it into view port) 
5. general:
   - undo and redo editing/changes
   - lasso: drag a rectangular to select states
   - zoom in/out (scale everything)
   - auto layout using Dagre auto-layout package (see demo at http://www.daviddurman.com/automatic-graph-layout-with-jointjs-and-dagre.html)  
   - drag-drop motion to create: 
      - new transition to connect two states
      - new transition and a new state


Hello,


I m new to jointJS, I need to create custom shapes using JointJS, I have tried creating the diamond shape using the Rectangle, making its height and width same, and then rotate by 45 degrees as follows,

var diamond =  new joint.shapes.basic.Rect({
        position: { x: 100, y: 100 },
        size: { width: 100, height: 100 },
        attrs: { diamond: { width: 100, height: 30 } }
    }); 
    diamond.attr({
        
        rect: { fill: '#cccccc', 'stroke-width': 2, stroke: 'black' },
        text: {
            text: 'Diamond', fill: '#3498DB',
            'font-size': 18, 'font-weight': 'bold', 
            'font-variant': 'small-caps', 
            'text-transform': 'capitalize'
        }
    });
  diamond.rotate(45);

However, the text present inside the rectangle also gets rotated, Any Ideas how can i proceed.... Also I need to create hexagon with a label... Any help will be much appreciated .... 

Thanks In Advance,

Mayuri
